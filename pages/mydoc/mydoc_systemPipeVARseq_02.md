## Generate workflow environment

Load workflow environment with sample data into your current working
directory. The sample data are described
[here](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/systemPipeR/inst/doc/systemPipeR.html#load-sample-data-and-workflow-templates).


```r
library(systemPipeRdata)
genWorkenvir(workflow = "varseq")
setwd("varseq")
```

Alternatively, this can be done from the command-line as follows:


```sh
Rscript -e "systemPipeRdata::genWorkenvir(workflow='varseq')"
```

In the workflow environments generated by `genWorkenvir` all data inputs are stored in
a `data/` directory and all analysis results will be written to a separate
`results/` directory, while the `systemPipeVARseq.Rmd` script and the `targets` file are expected to be located in the parent directory. The R session is expected to run from this parent
directory. Additional parameter files are stored under `param/`.

To work with real data, users want to organize their own data similarly
and substitute all test data for their own data. To rerun an established
workflow on new data, the initial `targets` file along with the corresponding
FASTQ files are usually the only inputs the user needs to provide.

## Run workflow

Now open the R markdown script `systemPipeVARseq.Rmd`in your R IDE (_e.g._ vim-r or RStudio) and 
run the workflow as outlined below. 

Here pair-end workflow example is provided. Please refer to the main vignette 
`systemPipeR.Rmd` for running the workflow with single-end data. 

### Run R session on computer node

In a computer cluster enviornment. Typically, after opening the `Rmd` file of 
this workflow in Vim and attaching a connected R session via the `F2` ( vim-r 
plugin installed) key, following command sequence can be used to run your R
session on a computer node.


```r
q("no")  # closes R session on head node
```


```bash
srun --x11 --partition=short --mem=2gb --cpus-per-task 4 --ntasks 1 --time 2:00:00 --pty bash -l
module load R/3.6.0
R
```

Now check your R session running environment.


```r
system("hostname")  # should return the computer name or cluster name
getwd()  # checks current working directory of R session
dir()  # returns content of current working directory
```

The `systemPipeR` package needs to be loaded to perform the analysis steps shown in
this report (H Backman et al., 2016).


```r
library(systemPipeR)
```

If applicable users can load custom functions not provided by `systemPipeR`. Skip
this step if this is not the case.


```r
source("systemPipeVARseq_Fct.R")
```

If you are running on a single machine, use following code as an exmaple to check 
if some tools used in this workflow are in your environment **PATH**. No warning 
message should be shown if all tools are installed.
